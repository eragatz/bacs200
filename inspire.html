        <p>A person that inspires me is a person that stands up for what they believe in and aspires to make a change for the better despite what others think.  </p>
        
        <p></p>
            
        <p>Tim Mcilrath exemplifys these traits without question. As the lead singer of the band Rise Against, Mcilrath uses his platform to share powerful messages about topics such as human rights, animal rights, and equality to name a few. Despite being a relatively famous, Mcilrath is humble and writes music about topics that matter to him the most. </p>
